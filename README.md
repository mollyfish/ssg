KnitWare:

The user enters their name and selects a sweater size. Then they enter their needle size and gauge over 4 inches for the project, before choosing the style of sweater they would like to make.  The app calculates the appropriate pattern and returns instructions to the user.

Future features:

If the user is a knitwear designer, they will be able to input a yarn, an ideal gauge, and select an option to have the app produce a suite of sizes and matching instructions, to create a saleable pattern.

Connect the app to the Ravelry database of yarns and yarn stores to make suggestions and provide additional choices like specific yarn brands or fiber content.
